== celluloid-fractal

This app is a simple POC using Puma with Celluloid to dynamically generate fractals (using fractals gem). At this time, this app implements the following fractal algorithms:

* Burning Ship
* Feigenbaum
* Mandelbrot
* Seahorse Valley
* Snowflake

Debian packaging, monitoration and logrotate included.

= TODO

* Makefile to automate build
* Fix celluloid fibers that are not freed
* Better fractal generation (fractal gem is SLOW)
